background_images  :- contains all original background images provided


final_out :- contains all final output iamges that sre to be used for assessment


masks :- auto generated masksed images of threat images


resized :- auto generated, resized and rotated threat image files


resized_masks :- auto generated resized and rotated masked images


ss :- contains screenshots used in the present README.md


threat_images :- contains all original images provided



# *Alternate files, to be used for improving software*
**NOT FOR ASSESSMENT PURPOSE**


*threats_resized :- alternate resized, rotated images saved after running the threat.py script mentioned below*


*adaptive_thresholding.py :- test script to implement openCV adaptive thresholding*


*baggage_blend.py :- blending and pasting threat_images to background_images*  **(PRIMITIVE STAGE)**


*test.ipynb :- temperory jupyter notebook used for testing purpose*


*threat.py :- NOT A VIRUS. alternate more automatized method for rotating, resizing, threat_images*  **(TO BE USED ALONG WITH baggage_blend.py)**


# ****SOLUTION FILES****

**final_out** :- final output images to be considered for assessment

**baggageAI.ipynb** :- final program jupyter notebook for assessment
